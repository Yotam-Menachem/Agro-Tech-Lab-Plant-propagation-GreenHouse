# Plant Propagation Greenhouse

This project utilizes the ESP-32 microcontroller board to create an automated plant propagation greenhouse. The greenhouse provides optimal conditions for plant growth by controlling temperature, humidity, and soil moisture levels using various sensors and actuators.

## Features

1. **Temperature Control**: The system maintains the temperature inside the greenhouse by heating the perlite when the temperature drops below the desired threshold of 30°C. This ensures that the plants receive adequate warmth for healthy growth.

2. **Cooling Mechanism**: When the temperature inside the greenhouse exceeds 25°C, the system activates cooling fans to circulate air and lower the temperature. Additionally, a cooling pad and CoolNet foggers (https://www.growirrigation.com/collections/netafim-coolnet-foggers) are utilized to provide additional cooling if necessary.

3. **Humidity Regulation**: The greenhouse is designed to maintain a consistent humidity level of 80%. This is achieved by carefully monitoring the humidity using sensors and adjusting the operation of the foggers to achieve the desired humidity range.

4. **Soil Moisture Control**: The system ensures that the soil moisture remains at an optimal level of 100% by employing a drip irrigation system. The soil moisture is monitored using sensors, and water is supplied through the drip irrigation mechanism to maintain the desired moisture level.

5. **Greenhouse Covering**: The greenhouse is covered with polyethylene to create a controlled environment. Additionally, the presence of window mesh allows for adequate airflow, ensuring proper ventilation and gas exchange for the plants.

## Getting Started

To replicate this project, follow these steps:

1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the ESP-32 microcontroller to the necessary sensors and actuators as per the circuit diagram provided.

2. **Arduino IDE**: Install the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and ensure that the ESP-32 board is properly recognized.

3. **Libraries**: Install the required libraries for the sensors and actuators used in the project. Refer to the documentation provided by the respective manufacturers for instructions on installing the libraries.

4. **Code**: Upload the provided Arduino sketch (code) to the ESP-32 microcontroller board. The sketch contains the necessary logic to control the greenhouse environment based on the sensor readings.

5. **Calibration**: Perform calibration for the sensors used to ensure accurate readings. Adjust the temperature, humidity, and moisture thresholds in the code according to your specific requirements.

6. **Power On**: Power up the system and monitor the greenhouse conditions through the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE.
