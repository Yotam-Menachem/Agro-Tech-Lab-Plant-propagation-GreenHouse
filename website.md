Using an HTML webpage with an Arduino project provides a powerful and flexible way to create a user interface and control system for the project. By leveraging HTML it is possible to
design and create interactive web pages that can be accessed and controlled from various devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets.

Integrating an HTML webpage with an Arduino project allows you to display sensor readings, receive user input, and control connected devices through a familiar and intuitive interface. You can design custom dashboards, charts, buttons, and input fields to visualize and interact with your project's data and functionalities. This provides a user-friendly experience and enables remote monitoring and control of your Arduino-based system.

you can see how we used HTML webpage in our [code](https://github.com/Yotam-Menachem/Agro-Tech-Lab-Plant-propagation-GreenHouse/blob/main/code.ino) file 

this is how our website is look like:
