# Project Components

To successfully complete this Arduino project using the ESP-32, you will need to gather the following components:

1. Relay: A relay module allows you to control high-power devices using a low-power signal from the ESP-32. This [tutorial](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-relay-module-ac-web-server/) provides information on how to connect and utilize a relay with the ESP-32.

2. Brushless DC Fans: These fans are commonly used for cooling purposes in various projects. This [tutorial](https://esp32io.com/tutorials/esp32-controls-fan) will guide you on how to control brushless DC fans with the ESP-32.

3. SHT31 - Waterproof Temperature and Humidity Sensor: The SHT31 sensor is capable of measuring temperature and humidity in harsh environments. You can learn more about this sensor and its connection to the ESP-32 in the [DFRobot Wiki](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/SHT31_Temperature_Humidity_Sensor_Weatherproof_SKU_SEN0385).

4. FDR - Frequency-Domain Sensor: The FDR sensor is commonly used for soil moisture measurements. This [tutorial](https://esp32io.com/tutorials/esp32-soil-moisture-sensor) will provide you with information on how to interface and utilize the FDR sensor with the ESP-32.

5. Solenoid Valve - AC 220V DC 12V "1/2": This solenoid valve allows you to control the flow of water or other liquids using the ESP-32. The [tutorial](https://esp32io.com/tutorials/esp32-water-liquid-valve) explains the connection and usage of this valve with the ESP-32.

6. DS18B20 - Waterproof Temperature Sensor for Soil Temperature Measurements: The DS18B20 sensor is specifically designed for measuring soil temperature. This [tutorial](https://www.electronicwings.com/esp32/ds18b20-sensor-interfacing-with-esp32) provides information on how to interface the DS18B20 sensor with the ESP-32.
